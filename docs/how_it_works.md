# Mathematical model


# Technical implementation in `jax`
This package uses `jax` as its backend for generating synthetic curves.
In particular, `jax` is used for:

- Solving non-linear optimization problems.
- Automatic differentiation for calculating partial derivates of `f`.
- Just-in-time (JIT)-compilation for performance optimization.
