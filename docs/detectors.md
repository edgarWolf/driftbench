# Detectors

## Overview

Here is an overview of the detectors implemented:


- [`AggregateFeatureAlgorithm`](driftbench.drift_detection.detectors.AggregateFeatureAlgorithm): Detector that aggregates features over temporal axis.
- [`MMDDetector`](driftbench.drift_detection.detectors.MMDDetector): Implementation of the MMD algorithm.


## Accessing hyperparameters


```python
detector.get_hparams()
```
